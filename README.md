DISCLAIMER
This project heavily uses ChatGPT for styling and layout. I use GPT only for components and info on what to do. The code isn't strictly copy pasted, I always run it through myself to make sure I understand
However because of the nature of AI there are things that can still look silly (Maplibre and Plain JS is not my specialty) and there might be glaring mistakes. Please contact me if any of this infringes on stuff you made in the past or if you see easy fixes!
It's just a little hobby thing that I wanted to put together to support my little brother. I spent a total of 1-2 hours on this atm
